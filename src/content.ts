            '15': 'That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.',
            '16': 'For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.',

            '18': 'The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,',
            '19': 'since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.',
            '20': 'For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.',
            '21': 'For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.',
            '22': 'Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools',
            '23': 'and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.',

            '26': 'Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.',
            '27': 'In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.',
            '28': 'Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.',

            '3': 'So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment? ',
            '4': 'Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?',
            '5': 'But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. ',
            '6': 'God “will repay each person according to what they have done.” ',
            '7': 'To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. ',
            '8': 'But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. ',
            '9': 'There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; ',
            '10': 'but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. ',
            '11': 'For God does not show favoritism.',
            '12': 'All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. ',
            '13': 'For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. ',
            '14': '(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. ',
            '15': 'They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) ',
            '16': 'This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.',
            '17': 'Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; ',
            '18': 'if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; ',
            '19': 'if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, ',

            '22': 'You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? ',
            '23': 'You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? ',
            '24': 'As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”',
            '25': 'Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. ',
            '26': 'So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? ',
            '27': 'The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.',
            '28': 'A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. ',
            '29': 'No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God.',

            '3': 'What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness? ',
            '4': 'Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”',
            '5': 'But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) ',
            '6': 'Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? ',
            '7': 'Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?” ',
            '8': 'Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!',
            '9': 'What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin. ',

            '28': 'For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. ',

            '28': 'Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.',
            '29': 'So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him,',
            '30': 'because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me.',

            '12': 'Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.',
            '13': 'Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,',
            '14': 'I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.',

            '19': 'Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.',
            '20': 'But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,',

            '11': 'I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.',
            '12': 'I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.',

            '14': 'Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.',

            '16': 'for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need.',
            '17': 'Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account.',
            '18': 'I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.',
            '19': 'And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.',
